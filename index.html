<h2> How I Got Started...</h2>
<p> I was originally interested in Ranken. I was going to attend for Web Design.<br> I was very intimidated at the thought  of entering a school soley dedicated to this field.<br> Scrolling through Facebook I saw the sign up information for Hands Up United Tech program on a friends page and I took a leap.<br> Click here for more information about <a href="http://www.handsupunited.org">(Hands Up United)</a> </p>
